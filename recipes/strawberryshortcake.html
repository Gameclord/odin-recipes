    <img src="../img/image.webp"alt="picture of srawberryshortcake">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This strawberry shortcake is the classic, sweet biscuit-style shortcake — not the pound cake variety.</p><p>The cake is sliced in half and layered with juicy strawberries and whipped cream for a delicious summertime treat.</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <un>
        <li>Strawberries: Of course, a strawberry shortcake needs strawberries. This recipe calls for three pints of fresh strawberries.</li>
        <li>Sugar: You'll use white sugar for both the strawberries and the shortcake.</li>
        <li>Flour: This strawberry shortcake is made almost like biscuits, so you'll need 2 ¼ cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Baking Powder: Baking powder helps the shortcake rise</li>
        <li>Salt: Just a hint of salt adds a depth of flavor to the shortcake.</li>
        <li>Shortening: Shortening is a classic shortcake ingredient, but reviewers say they've also had success using butter instead.</li>
        <li>Egg: One egg binds the dough together.</li>
        <li>Milk: Your milk of choice will keep the dough moist.</li>
        <li>Whipped Heavy Cream: Homemade whipped cream tops this cake.</li>
    
    </un>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the berries: Slice the strawberries and cover them with white sugar.</li>
        <li>Make the batter: Combine the dry ingredients, then cut in the shortening until the mixture is crumbly. Add the egg and milk and stir until combined.</li>
        <li>Bake the cake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Assemble the strawberry shortcake: Cut the cake in half. Top the bottom layer with half the strawberries, then replace the top of the cake. Top the cake with the remaining berries and whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

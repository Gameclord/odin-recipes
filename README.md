# odin-recipes
First project is creating recipe page using html knowledge.
This is a fun little project to build a recipe website. I learned a lot about Git and Github as i had to commit often. Though I made mistakes with my commit messages, I have learned how important a message is.

I also got to practice what I have learned in the foundations like; boilerplaites,headings, paragraphs. alternative text, images, links, unordered and ordered lists.

Looking forward to more projects.
